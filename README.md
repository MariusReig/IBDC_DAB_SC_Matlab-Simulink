# IBDC_DAB_SC_Matlab-Simulink
This repository include a Matlab/Simulink development of an isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter integrated with a supercapacitor and a supercacitor model with cell balancing.  

IBDC_DAB_SC.slx contains the IBDC model. 

SC_Cell_Balancing.slx contains the SC model. 

- The initialize file is required for both models. 

ADC_SC_Control.slx contains a control program for ADC and GPIO used with the F28379D Launchpad.
